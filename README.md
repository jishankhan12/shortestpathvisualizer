Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer


live demo link:https://jishankhan12.github.io/shortestpathvisualizer/

📋 Project Overview

An interactive web application that visualizes various pathfinding algorithms in real-time.

Users can set start/end points, draw obstacles, and watch how different algorithms find paths through a dynamic grid system.



🚀 Features

4 Pathfinding Algorithms: Dijkstra, A*, Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS)

Interactive Grid: Click to set start/end points and draw walls

Real-time Visualization: Watch algorithms explore paths with smooth animations

Customizable Settings: Adjust grid size and animation speed

Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile devices



🛠️ Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6), jQuery, Bootstrap 5

Algorithms: Pure JavaScript implementations

Styling: Custom CSS with Bootstrap components

Icons: Font Awesome




🎮 How to Use

Set Start/End Points: Double-click any grid cell to set start (first click) and end (second click) positions

Draw Walls: Click and drag to create obstacles, or use the "Wall" button for random walls

Select Algorithm: Choose from dropdown (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A*)

Adjust Settings: Use sliders for grid size and animation speed

Visualize: Click "Visualize" to see the algorithm in action

Reset: Use "Clear" to start over





🎨 Visual Elements

Blue: Start and end points

Dark Blue: Walls and obstacles

Orange: Visited/explored nodes

Green: Shortest path found




🔧 Algorithms Explained

BFS: Explores all neighbors at current depth first (guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs)

DFS: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking

Dijkstra: Finds shortest path in weighted graphs using priority queue

A*: Uses heuristics to find shortest path more efficiently
